# AI, ML, DL, Data Science - Overview

✅ What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)?
AI is the ability of a machine to do tasks that normally need human thinking—like learning, problem-solving, and decision making.

✅ What is ML (Machine Learning)?
ML is a part (subset) of AI. It helps machines learn from data without being directly programmed. Example: Email spam filters.

✅ What is DL (Deep Learning)?
DL is a subset of ML. It uses big neural networks (like the human brain) for tasks like image recognition, voice recognition, etc.

✅ What is Data Science?
It is the process of collecting, analyzing, and making decisions from large amounts of data. It uses AI, ML, statistics, etc.

✅ What is Data Analytics?
It focuses on analyzing raw data and finding useful information, trends, or patterns from it.

✅ What is Computer Vision?
It is a part of AI that deals with images and videos. Tasks include:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Image segmentation
- Tracking

✅ What is NLP (Natural Language Processing)?
It helps machines understand and respond to human language (text or speech). Example: Chatbots, Google Translate.

✅ What is LLM (Large Language Models)?
LLMs are advanced models trained on lots of text (like ChatGPT) to understand and generate language.

✅ What is GenAI (Generative AI)?
GenAI can create new content like text, images, music, code, etc. Example: DALL·E, ChatGPT.
